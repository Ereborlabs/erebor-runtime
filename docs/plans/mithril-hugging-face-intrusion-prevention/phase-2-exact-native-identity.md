# Phase 2: Exact Native Identity

Status: Proposed; depends on Phase 1 `Done`.

Master: [Mithril Hugging Face Intrusion Prevention](./README.md)
Design: [Validated readable architecture](./policy-and-protection-algorithm-architecture-readable.md)

## Purpose

Establish exact task, process, execution, native-family, entry, container, and
runtime-root identity before any later phase uses identity for authority.

## Design Coverage

Chapters 6-9 and 13; Appendices A.8-A.10, A.12, and A.14.

## Deliverables

### D2.1 — Identity/state ABI and owners

Implement task storage labels, `TaskCoordinateV1`, process/execution/native
state, entry security state, generation references, lifetimes, tombstones, and
atomic transition maps under `NativeSecurityStateOwner` and
`WorkloadBindingOwner`. `KernelHostOwner` owns map lifecycle, not semantics.

### D2.2 — Native creation before first effect

Using the approved Jailer/Tetragon-derived dossier entries, label fork, clone,
thread, and vfork children before they can perform a protected effect. Copy
task-local state from the real parent, create new task/process/execution IDs as
defined, and fail first effect closed on allocation/finalization uncertainty.
Never use delayed PID enrollment.

### D2.3 — Exact exec transaction

Implement staged exec identity, immutable image candidate, pre-/post-PONR
failure handling, success commit, non-leader exec, scripts/interpreters,
`execveat`/`fexecve`, and concurrent-exec serialization. A failed/unknown exec
never restores broader authority.

### D2.4 — Runtime and container-root classification

Bind cgroup/container execution sets and classify initial, native, external,
and unresolved roots. Probes, lifecycle hooks, `kubectl exec`, `crictl exec`,
init/sidecars, ephemeral containers, moved tasks, and unmatched workloads keep
their validated distinctions. Identical argv/timing/TTY never creates purpose.

### D2.5 — Authorization proof and administrative slot identity

Implement signed-envelope verification, trust/time/replay foundations and the
identity side of the approved one-use administrative exec slot. This phase may
bind and consume identity state in fixtures, but Phase 4 owns permission and
physical exec denial.

### D2.6 — Restart, reuse, and reference reconciliation

Reconcile live tasks/cgroups/containers after daemon/runtime/kubelet restart;
prove PID/TID, cgroup, namespace, Pod/container name, and object reuse do not
inherit authority. Lost cleanup leaks restriction and requires reconciliation.

## Required Tests And Fixtures

All applicable `ENTRY-*`, `ID-*`, `EXEC-*`, `STATE-*`,
`NATIVE-STATE-REF-LIFETIME-001`, `AUTHORIZATION-REPLAY-004`, and
`ADMIN-EXEC-APPROVAL-001` cases in Appendix C, including identical native
child/probe/admin commands and non-leader exec.

## Acceptance

- Every protected effect lookup begins with exact task identity, never cgroup.
- Native inheritance is installed before the child can use protected
  authority; missing task storage cannot allow.
- Runtime-created roots receive exact or conservative classification with no
  command-based purpose.
- All state/reference transitions are atomic, bounded, restart-safe, and
  generation-retaining.
- No file/network/device permission is granted in this phase.

## Excluded

Policy matching, effect allow/deny tables, graph conclusions, and response.

## Phase Result

State: Not done.  
Completed deliverables: none.  
Verification: not run; this is a plan rewrite.  
Next phase: not authorized.
